## !important
The source code was developed as a byproduct of the projects and methods presented in [1,2]. It promotes a new CAD modeling paradigm---data-driven, generative B-spline modeling---focusing on parameterization and knot placement for approximating unorganized points. The core principle is to replace manual heuristics with data-driven insights, enhancing modeling accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

It can be run with Pytorch 2.0.1 + CUDA 11.8 on the operating system Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Windows, Mac.

3.Installing (Windows/Linux/Mac + Pytorch 2.0.1 + CUDA 11.8)
-------------------------------------------

- Environment setup

    ```shell
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate splinegen
    # install geomdl with pip
    pip install geomdl
    ```

- To create the dataset, a curve intersection detect module is also needed installed.

    ```shell
    cd ops/3d_intersect_detect
    pip install .
    ```

4.Usage
-------

- You can take four steps to train the SplineGen with src/splinegen/main.py

    ```shell
    # train encoder
    python src/splinegen/main.py train_encoder --dataset_path /home/lab/spline/data/2d_train.npz 
    # train knot decoder
    python src/splinegen/main.py train_knot_decoder --dataset_path /home/lab/spline/data/2d_train.npz --encoder_path /home/lab/spline/SplineGen/src/splinegen/results/train_encoder/models/20250716-034900/epoch_10.pth
    # train parameter decoder
    python src/splinegen/main.py train_param_decoder --dataset_path /home/lab/spline/data/2d_train.npz --knot_path /home/lab/spline/SplineGen/src/splinegen/results/train_knot_decoder/models/20250716-045058/epoch_10.pth
    # train knot decoder
    python src/splinegen/main.py train_diff_approximation --dataset_path /home/lab/spline/data/2d_train.npz --base_model_path /home/lab/spline/SplineGen/src/splinegen/results/train_param_decoder/models/20250716-052017_epoch_9.pth

    python src/splinegen/main.py test --dataset_path /home/lab/spline/data/2d_eval.npz --model_path /home/lab/spline/SplineGen/src/splinegen/results/train_diff_approximation/models/20250716-060440/epoch_5.pth
    ```

- You can test the model by the command following

    ```shell
    python src/splinegen/main.py test --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --model_path /path/to/splinegen 
    ```

- To create 2D/3D dataset, run

    ```shell
    python src/splinegen/process/gen2d_curve.py
    python src/splinegen/process/gen3d_curve.py
    ```
